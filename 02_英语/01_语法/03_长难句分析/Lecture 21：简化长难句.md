## 21.1 引入
**为什么需要简化长难句**
+ 在通过分析长难句、将句子划分成了多个简单句之后，单个的简单句也可能会很复杂；
+ 因为句子当中会有很多扩展的内容，此时可以对其再进行简化；

## 21.2 简化长难句
### 21.2.1 方法
**简化方法**
+ 1. 定位谓语动词；
	+ 确定是一个单独的简单句；
+ 2. 去扩展、找核心；
	+ 把没用的去掉了，剩下的就是核心的；
	+ 先去掉非核心成分，先看核心成分；看懂之后，再看非核心成分；

**简单句的核心成分**
+  核心成分：
	+ 主语、谓语、宾语、表语、补语；
+ 非核心成分：
	+ 形容词、副词、介词短语、同位语、插入语和非谓语动词 (作定语、状语)

### 21.2.2 举例分析
**举例**
+ *The decision of the New york Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbertas its next music director <u>has been</u> the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of hisappointment in 2009*
	+ 这句话是一个简单句，因为只有唯一的一个谓语动词 has been；
	+ 只要非谓语动词做的不是句子的主语、宾语，都可以去掉；
	+ 核心句：
		+ ... Decision  ... Has been ... Talk
		+ 这个决定，在过去完成之后一直是话题
	+ 扩展：
		+ 纽约爱乐乐团的决定；
		+ 决定是：作为下一任的音乐总监
		+ 自从它的任命在 2009 年被突然宣布；
+ *During the late 1990 s, national spending on social sciences andthe humanities as a percentage of all research and developmentfunds-including government, higher education, non-profit andcorporate-varied from around 4% to 25%...*
	+ 谓语动词：varied
	+ 核心： 
		+ ... spending ... Varied
		+ 花费有所不同
+ *A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of a coolingtower in 2007 and the discovery of an underground pipe systemleakage, raised serious questions about both Vermont yankee'ssafety and Entergy's management-especially after thecompany made misleading statements about the pipe.*
	+ 谓语动词：raised、made
	+ 两件事情，需要断开；
		+ 找标点：逗号没有，破折号解释说明、有用；
	+ 连接词：after -> 时间状语从句；
	+ 两句话：
		+ A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of acooling tower in 2007 and the discovery of an undergroundpipe system leakage, raised serious questions about bothVermont yankee's safety and Entergy's management.
			+ 核心：A string of accidents... Raised ... Questions ...
		+ especially after the company made misleading statementsabout the pipe.
			+ 核心：after ... Company made ...  Statements..
+ *Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the Federal Circuit itself that introduced suchpatents with its 1998 decision in the so-called State Street Bankcase, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual fund assets.*
	+ 谓语动词：would be、was、introduced
		+ 但 was、introduced 在同一个强调句内，所以不需要断开成两段；
	+ 断成两段：
		+ Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face 
			+ 核心：curbs ... Would be ... About face
		+ because it was the Federal Circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called State StreetBank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual fundassets.
			+ 核心：because it was the Federal Circuit itself that introduced such patents ... 
+ *As a discovery claim works its way through the community, theinteraction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transformsan individual's discovery claim into the community's credible discovery*
	+ 切分成两段：
		+ As a discovery claim works its way through the community.
			+ 核心：As…discovery claim works its way
		+ the **interaction and confrontation** between shared andcompeting beliefs about the science and the technology involved **transforms** an individual's **discovery claim** into thecommunity's credible discovery.
			+ 核心：interaction and confrontation ... Transforms ... Discovery claim

## 21.3 真题演练
**举例**
+ *From the beginning of our history, sayss Hofstadter, ourdemocratic and populist urges have driven us to rejectanything that smells of elitism.*
	+ sayss Hofstadter：插入语，不用管
	+ 两个谓语动词：have driven、smells
	+ 断开：
		+ From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything 
			+ From the beginning of our history 多个介词短语构成，其中包含名词，基本都是插入语；
			+ 核心：urges have driven us to reject anything 
				+ 这种刺激、激动驱动我们去做任何事情
		+ that smells of elitism.
+ *By linking directly to our nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too sothat we can start to develop full sensory environments, ratherlike the holidays in Total Recall or the Star Trek holodeck...*
	+ 断开：谓语动词 `->` could pick up、feel、simulate、can start 
		+ 因为 feel、simulate 在 and 的左右，所以是并列的成分，不能用于断开；
	+ 连接词：what、so that 
	+ 断开： 
		+ By linking directly to our nervous system, computers could pick up
			+ 核心：主语和谓语动词保留 `->` computers could pick up
		+ what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too
			+ 核心：what we feel... Simulate feeling...
		+ so that we can start to develop full sensory environments, ratherlike the holidays in Total Recall or the Star Trek holodeck...
			+ 核心：so that we can start to develop ... Environments
+ *The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entryof women into the maledominated job market have limited theopportunities of teenagers who are already questioning theheavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan's rigidsocial ladder to good schools and jobs.*
	+ 断开： 
		+ The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the maledominated job market **have limited** the opportunities of teenagers 
			+ 简化：因为是并列句
				+ 主语 `->` The coming 
				+ 主语 `->` and an entry
			+ 谓语：**have limited** the opportunities
		+ **who** **are** already questioning the heavy personal sacrificesinvolved in climbing Japan's rigid social ladder to goodschools and jobs
			+ who are already questioning ... Sacrifices.
+ *For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smithand W.J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis ofinadequate information, that farming, pottery making, andmetallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffusedthroughout the world*
	+ 断开：

		+ that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originatedin ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world.
			+ 核心：that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated  ... And diffused
+ *As the interaction between organism and environment hascome to be understood, however, effects once assigned tostates of mind, feelings, and traits are beginning to betraced to accessible conditions, and a technology of Behavior may therefore become available.*

## 30.4 考场攻略
**攻略**：“两步分析法”解决一切基本结构的长难句
