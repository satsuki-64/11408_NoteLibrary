## 22.0 引入
**三类特殊结构**
+ 第一节：分裂结构 
+ 第二节：嵌套结构
+ 第三节：平行结构
+ 就是基于普通的长难句，加上一些变化；
+ 只需要现针对特殊结构做一些处理，然后处理完成之后还是【断开】+【简化】

## 22.1 什么是分裂结构
**分裂结构**
+ 概述：
	+ 原本正常、连贯的句子，加上其他内容，使得其变成了分裂结构；
+ 核心：
	+ 找到分裂，还原连贯；
+ 方法：
	+ 把造成分裂的内容找到，将其**还原成连贯**的，接下来继续按照分析长难句的方法正常分析；
	+ 1. 插入式分裂结构：把插入的内容去掉（重点），通常会使用两个标点符号隔出来；
	+ 2. 从句后移式的分裂结构：把后移的内容往前提；

## 22.2 插入式分裂结构
### 22.2.1 同位语、插入语造成的分裂结构
**同位语与插入语**
+ 同位语：解释、说明前面的名词；
+ 插入语：从结构上，插入到句子当中进行解释的；
+ 但是：分析长难句时，不需要区分它们两个。只要认出插入的成分即可；
+ 特征：
	+ **经常出现的成对的标点**；

**举例**
+ *Bob Liodice<u>, the chief executive of the Association of NationalAdvertisers, </u>says consumers will be worse off if the industrycannot collect information about their preferences. *
	+ 两个标点中间分割出来的一段是插入语，表示解释前面的人名 `->` 补充说明背景信息；
	+ 把这段去掉后，内容是连贯的：
		+ Bob Liodice … says consumers will be worse off **if** the industrycannot collect information about their preferences.
	+ 数谓语动词：
		+ say、will be、cannot collect 
	+ 连接词：if
	+ 分析主谓：
		+ Bob Liodice … says consumers will be worse off 
		+ 主谓主谓结构；
	+ 断开后：
		+ Bob Liodice … says
		+ consumers will be worse off
	+ 然后分析完后，再将同位语、插入语拿回来，继续看；
+ *These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields<u>, they say, </u>and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.*
	+ 去除掉插入语 they say；
	+ These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields and they want to use their wealth to draw attention tothose who have succeeded in science.
	+ 分析谓语动词：
		+ have succedded
		+ want
		+ have succeeded
	+ 可以断开成三段：
	+ 连接词：and、who
		+ These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields
		+ and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those
		+ Who have succeeded in science.
+ *Yet it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, accordingto the two-step flow theory, are supposed to drive socialepidemics by influencing their friends and colleagues directly.*


### 22.2.2 从句插入造成分裂 
**概念**
+ 状语从句三种位置：
+ 前面、后面、中间；
+ **翻译成前面、后面都可以**，一般可以翻译成前面比较顺；

**举例**
+ *Peter Hardy, who sympathies with the views of the energy sector, is resisting proposed changes to science standards forpre-teen pupils.*
	+ 插入部分： who sympathies with the views of the energy sector
	+ 断开：
		+ Peter Hardy…is resisting proposed changes to sciencestandafds for pre-teen pupils.
		+ who sumpathies with the views of the enerqy sector
+ *Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community and<u>, if itsstability depends on its integrity, </u>they are entitled to continuance.*
	+ Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community
	+ and… they are entitled to continuance.
	+ if itsstability depends on its integrity 
+ *Branch points out that, even if a growing number of officialguidelines and textbooks reflect scientific consensus on climatechange, unofficial educational materials that convey more biasedperspectives are being distributed to teachers.*
	+ Branch points out
	+ that … unofficial educational materials … are being distributedto teachers.
	+ that convey more biased perspectives
	+ ,even if a growing number of official guidelines and textbooksreflect scientific consensus on climate change.

## 22.3 从句后移式分裂结构

**举例**
+ *Contrary to the descriptions on record, no systematic evidence was found <u>that</u> levels of productivity were related to changes inlighting.*
	+ 从句：levels of productivity were related to changes inlighting `->` 解释说明前面的 evidence `->` 从句被后移到了 was found 后背；
	+ 移回来之后：
		+ *Contrary to the descriptions on record, no systematic **evidence that levels of productivity were related to changes in lighting** was found.*
+ *In 2005, IBM <u>noted</u> in a court filing <u>that it had been issued more Than 300 business method patents</u>...*
	+ 其中在 noted 和从句之间间隔了 in a court filing；
	+ 因此可以前移：
		+ In 2005, IBM noted that it had been issued more than 300 business method patents in a court filing...

## 22.4 真题演练
**举例**
+ *What is being called artificial general intelligence<u>, machines that would mimic the way humans think, </u>continues to evade scientists*
	+ 插入造成的分裂结构；
	+ 句子连贯起来：
		+ What is being called artificial general intelligence... Continues to evade scientists.
		+ evade：逃避、使... 困惑（这道题用的是这个）
	+ 插入部分：
		+ machines that would mimic the way humans think -> 解释 artificial general intelligence 这个名词；
+ *When one of these noneconomic categories is threatenedand<u>, if we happen to love it, </u>we invent excuses to give iteconomic importance.*
	+ noneconomic：没有经济价值的；
	+ 插入的内容：条件状语从句
	+ 当没有经济价值的种类是受到威胁时，我们就会给他一个借口，让它有经济价值；
+ *Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today's people<u>-especially those born to familieswho have lived in the U.S.for many generations-</u>apparentlyreached their limit in the early 1960 s.*
	+ especially those born to familieswho have lived in the U.S.for many generations -> 解释说明 today's people 这个名词，限定意思；
+ *Concerns were raised that witnesses might be encouragedto exaggerate their stories in court to ensure guiltyverdicts.*
	+ 从句：that witnesses might be encouragedto exaggerate their stories in court to ensure guiltyverdicts `->` 本来是用于解释 concerns 担心的；
	+ 但是被后移到了 were raised 后背；
	+ 往前移：
		+ Concerns **that witnesses might be encouraged to exaggerate Their stories in court to ensure quilty verdicts** were raised
+ *This<u>, though it fulfills the laws and requirements ofFuturist poetry, </u>can hardly be classed as Literature.*
	+ This -> 主语 -> 后背的内容是插入的
	+ 主句：this can hardlu be classed as Literature 
	+ 从句：though it fulfills the laws and requirements ofFuturist poetry -> 解释为什么很难；
+ *If connections can be bought, a basic premise ofdemocratic societythat all are equal in treatment by is undermined government*
+ *One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oilprices is that<u>, unlike the rises in the 1970 s,</u> it has notoccurred against the background of general commodity-priceinflation and global excess demand.*
