## 19.2 如何断开连接词
### 19.2.1 连接词的使用
**使用**
+ 1. 前后是否为句子
	+ 首先需要判断，连接词接的是不是句子；
	+ 连接词前后必须得是句子；
+ 2. 找到句子结束的地方

**从句的范围**
+ 概念：
	+ 从句开始于连接词，结束于三种位置；
+ 三类结束位置：
	+ 步骤1. 结束于标点；
	+ 步骤2. 结束于下一个连接词前；
	+ 步骤3. 结束于第二个谓语动词之前；
+ 两种从句类型：
	+ 类型一：开火车
		+ 结束位置：1 和 2
		+ `句子1` + 连接词/标点 + `句子2` + 连接词/标点 + `句子3` ...
	+ 类型二：大句包小句
		+ `句子 1：#####(句子 2&&&&&)####`
		+ 结束位置：3
			+ 小句子要结束在大句子的**谓语动词**之前；
			+ 如果每句当中断开后，都有一个谓语动词，则为断开成功。如果使用标点和连接词断开的句子中，有句子没有谓语动词，则此句子往后找第二个谓语动词，**第二个谓语动词前、连接词后的**，为需要断开的句子；
+ 补充 1：
	+ 并列连词不能断的两个例外：
	+ 1. 位于句首的并列连词不能用于断开，因为句首的并列连词服务于上句话；
	+ 2. 并列句后背的句子不完整时，不能断。比如并列句后背的句子缺少谓语动词时，不能断开；
+ 补充 2：
	+ 如果连接词的前后不是句子，则这个连接词无效，不需要从这里断开

**补充**：关于 $-ed$ 结尾的动词
+ 过去式 `->` 谓语；
+ 过去分词 `->` 非谓语；
+ 判断方法：
	+ 意思是主动的 -> 谓语动词；
		+ We used the car for 2 years.
	+ 意思是被动的 -> 非谓语动词；
		+ This is a used car.

### 19.2.2 断开连接词举例：结束于标点+连接词
**举例**
+ *One of the reasons why the appointment came as such asurprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known.*
	+ 断开前的准备工作：数谓语动词
		+ 注意：不要数非谓语动词；
		+ 谓语动词：三态+一否（三态：时态、情态、语态）；
	+ 第一步：找谓语动词
		+ *One of the reasons why the appointment <u>came</u> as such asurprise, however, <u>is</u> that Gilbert <u>is</u> comparatively little <u>known</u>.*
		+ 注意：is ... Know 是一个
	+ 第二步：找连接词
		+ why、that
		+ *One of the reasons <u>why</u> the appointment came as such asurprise, however, is <u>that</u> Gilbert is comparatively little known.*
	+ 分开后：
		+ 先看主句，再看从句
		+ One of the reasons **why**…, however, is **that**….
		+ **Why** the appointment came as such a surprise, however
		+ **That** Gilbert is comparatively little known.
+ *The digital services tax now awaits the signature of PresidentEmmanuel Macron, who has expressed support for the measure. And it could go into effect within the next few weeks.*
	+ 谓语动词：awaits、has expressed、could go
	+ 两个连接词：*，who* 和 *，and* 
	+ The digital services tax now awaits the signature of PresidentEmmanuel Macron, who…, and…
	+ **Who** has expressed support for the measure.
	+ **And** it could go into effect within the next few weeks.
+ *Some species of trees have been “read out of the party” byeconomics-minded foresters because they grow too slowly, orhave too low a sale value to pay as timber crops.*
	+ 注意：并列句如果不完整，则不能断开
	+ 句子一：Some species of trees have been “read out of the party” byeconomics-minded foresters because…, or…
	+ 句子二：Because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale value topay as timber crops.
		+ 其中的 *, or* 因为句子不完整，不能断开；
+ *Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, becausethey largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not thelikely extent of bad debts.*
	+ 谓语动词：argue、overstate、reflect
	+ 标点：第一个逗号有用，第二个逗号没用，因为后背没有谓语动词了；
	+ 从绝：that、because
	+ 断成三段；
		+ Today they argue that…, because…
		+ that market prices overstate losses,
		+ Because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity ofmarkets, not the likelu extent of bad debts
+ *But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that wecan sau with considerable assurance.*
	+ 谓语动词：take、is、can say
	+ 连接词：but、and、that，但是句首的 but 没有用；
		+ 句首的并列连词不能用于断开句子；
	+ But take a longer view and… that..
	+ And there is a surprising amount
	+ That we can say with considerable assurance.
+ *Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready toscale back on business-method patents, which have beencontroversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago.*
	+ Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready toscale back on business-method patents, which... Ever since…..
	+ **Which** have been controversial
	+ **Ever since** they were first authorized 10 years ago.
+ *The principle of British welfare is no longer that you can insureyourself against the risk of unemployment and receiveunconditional payments if the disaster happens.*
	+ is、can insure、receive、happens
	+ 虽然是四个谓语动词，但这里右 and receive，并列句不完整，要和前面共享成分 `->` 不断开；
	+ that、and、if
	+ The principle of British welfare is no longer that.. If...
	+ That you can insure yourself agginst the risk of unemployment andreceive unconditional pauments
	+ if the disaster happens.
+ *In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about theworld are waiting to be observed and collected by objectiveresearchers who use the scientific method to carry out their work.*
	+ In the idealized versionfacts about the world are waitingof how to be observed and collected by objective researchers who…..
	+ How science is done, 
	+ Who use the scientific method to carry out their work

### 19.2.3 断开连接词举例：结束于谓语动词
**举例**
+ *The hardest task that television asks of anyone is to turn thepower off after he has turned it on.*
	+ 确定谓语动词：asks、is、has turned 
	+ 第一次断开：根据连接词断开
		+ The hardest task 
		+ that television asks of anyone is to turn thepower off
		+ after he has turned it on 
		+ 断开失败，因为第一句*The hardest task* 当中没有谓语动词；
	+ 如果每句当中断开后，都有一个谓语动词，则为断开成功。如果使用标点和连接词断开的句子中，有句子没有谓语动词，则此句子往后找第二个谓语动词，第二个谓语动词前、连接词后的，为需要断开的句子；
	+ 第二次断开：找第二个谓语动词
		+ The hardest task ... Is to turn thepower off...
		+ that television asks of anyone 
		+ after he has turned it on
+ *Until now, many sellers that have a physical presence in only asingle state or a few states have been able to avoid chargingsales taxes when they ship to addresses outside those states*
+ *Second, the majority of people who use networked computers toupload are not even aware of the significance of what they aredoing.*
	+ Second, the majority of people ... Are not even aware of the significance of
	+ who use networked computers toupload
	+ what they aredoing.
